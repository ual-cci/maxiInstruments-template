# maxiInstruments-template

A template for maxiInstruments 0.7.2 sample loading

This template shows you how to use the threaded audio worklet for loading audio files in a CORS enabled way, using the shared array buffer in the worklet for custom DSP. The reason for using custom DSP is...er.. it is custom. Also there's a built in sequencer and a bunch of other stuff that is compatible with magenta etc. if you are interested in that stuff. But basically, if you want real DSP in a browser that can be served in git pages in 2023, this is it.
