# maxiInstruments-template

A template for maxiInstruments 0.7.2 sample loading

This template shows you how to use the threaded audio worklet for loading audio files in a CORS enabled way, using the shared array buffer in the worklet for custom DSP. The reason for using custom DSP is...er.. it is custom. Also there's a built in sequencer and a bunch of other stuff that is compatible with magenta etc. if you are interested in that stuff. But basically, if you want real DSP in a browser that can be served in git pages in 2023, this is it. 

Demo is here:

maxiInstruments is written and maintained by louismac as part of the machine learning lib for creatives, learner.js, which was created as part of the mimic project, funded by UKRI. maxiInstruments makes my Maximilian library much easier to use in js, for which I am eternally grateful.
